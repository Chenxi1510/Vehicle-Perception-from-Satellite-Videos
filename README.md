## Vehicle Perception from Satellite

The repository presents the TMS dataset, with data collection and preprocessing, data annotation, and data statistics for the TMS dataset.





### Data Download  
 
TMS Dataset Link: [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1zV4q6brBDb8a1ypgy2uLNw) .

Verification Code: 1510.

### Data Collection and Preprocessing
The real part of TMS is composed of 12 full satellite videos. They are captured by the non-stationary satellite platform, *i.e.*, Jilin-1 and SkySat-1, with the ground sample distance of 1m or so. In this case, the vehicles only contain 5-20 pixels.
Five of the videos are freely provided by the official website of [Jilin-1](https://mall.charmingglobe.com/Sampledata), and the others are crawled from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/). The synthetic part of TMS contains 14 videos obtained from the game of  [GTA-V](https://www.rockstargames.com/gta-v).
